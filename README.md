# Suprreme Bot V.1

This bot takes a URL that is provided by the user of a specific product on Supreme.com
And purchases the product based on the information provided in the Store_Your_Info.py file.
If the product is out of stock, it will not work.

To get started you will need to have latest Python installed.

#### STEP ONE
```
- git clone https://github.com/arafatiqbal/SupremeBot
- cd SupremeBot
- virtualenv venv --python=python3.8.5
- pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### STEP TWO
```
If you don't have it already, make sure you download a chrome driver for your operating system. 
Once that is done, take the chrome driver path, and insert it into line 53 of SupremeBotV1.py file.

chromdriver: http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
```
#### STEP THREE
```
- Run the Program with python SupremeBotV1.py
```

This program was made for educational purposes only.
I wanted to try and learn something new, and therefore created this program. 
It is free to use by anyone, so give it a try, and try to edit to make it even better.

Thank you for your time!
